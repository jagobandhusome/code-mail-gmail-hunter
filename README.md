Last N characters (user-defined, typically 8-13)

First 8 characters of the derived password

Last 8 characters of the email address

Files Generated
Valid Number.txt - Successful email/password combinations

others_problem.txt - Accounts with login issues

Setup Requirements
Python 3.9+

Chrome browser

MongoDB connection credentials

number.txt file containing email addresses to test

Usage
Place email addresses in number.txt (one per line)
